Project: Sockets and HTTP

How to run:

Navigate to the folder that each of the python files reside.

To run part 1, "Using a socket to GET a file", on the terminal, type:
    python connect_socket.py

To run part 2, "GET the data for a large file", on the terminal, type:
    python lab2.py
    (this may take a few seconds to run depending on the system)

To run part 3, "The worldâ€™s simplest HTTP server", on the terminal, type:
    python http_server.py
You should then see a message with the IP address (local) of where it's connected and a message saying the server is ready
That address should be 127.0.0.1:7777. Open an internet browser and go to 127.0.0.1:7777
On the browser, the page will render text saying "Congratulations! You've downloaded the first Wireshark lab file!"
Back in the server terminal, you'll see messages about the request received and what it sent back.


(all three parts will auto stop once run through)

** note - each python file has hardcoded into it the server/client name and the request, so all the user has to do is run the program to see the results
